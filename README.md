<br>
**2. Data Wrangling, which includes data cleaning tasks**
<br>
**3. Extracting Insights (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
<br>
**4. Visualization through Tableau**

### The repo contanis the following items: 
**1. Dataset**
<br>
**2. EDA Notebook**
<br>
**3. Tableau Dashboard**
<br>

### Software requirements:

The code is written in Python, so make sure to have the latest version of python installed. For scripting, either an IDE or an online platform such as Jupyter or Google Colab could be used.

### Libraries required

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. All these could be installed using pip instsall 'library-name' in the command line of your IDE or operating system. In case of using google colab, you could directly import these libraries as these are already pre-installed
