# Netflix-Data-Analysis
This project explores some previously unexplored insights pertaining to movies on Netflix.

### Introduction
This repository holds an EDA project, analyzing Netflix data. The dataset has 7789 records. However, we did encounter a significant proportion of missing data which had to be dropped to ennsure sanctity of the EDA process. After dropping missing data, the final dataset has 4809 rows.

### The EDA process is a 4 step approach, namely: 
**1. Exploring the data**
<br>
**2. Data Wrangling, which includes data cleaning tasks**
<br>
**3. Extracting Insights**
<br>
**4. Visualization**

### The repo contanis the following items: 
**1. Dataset**
<br>
**2. EDA Notebook**
<br>

### Software requirements:

The code is written in Python, so make sure to have the latest version of python installed. For scripting, either an IDE or an online platform such as Jupyter or Google Colab could be used.

### Libraries required

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. All these could be installed using pip instsall 'library' in the command line of your IDE or operating system. In case of using google colab, you could directly mport these libraries as these are already pre-installed
